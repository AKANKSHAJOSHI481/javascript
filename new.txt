before we start I want you to know that
0:02
    this is the most important video that I
0:04
    have made so far yeah break thoughts
0:09
    which I talk a lot about daily action
0:13
    because my site break the twitch comm is
0:15
    all about connecting our daily action to
0:18
    our long-term vision but I think
0:21
    something that's very common that we
0:23
    tend to do a lot is to say I'm going to
0:26
    do something and in a way saying that
0:29
    we're going to do something we get a
0:31
    dopamine response from saying it and it
0:34
    often feels good enough that we don't
0:36
    actually have to do the thing that we're
0:38
    going to do and in that moment you are a
0:41
    person that says that they're going to
0:44
    do something that is the action that you
0:46
    have taken there is one change that you
0:49
    can make right now and it is
0:51
    ridiculously easy take that thing that
0:55
    you said you were going to do find the
0:58
    smallest most ridiculously stupid easy
1:02
    form of that thing and do it right now
1:07
    no matter how small no matter how
1:10
    minuscule the aspect of doing that thing
1:14
    is you will be doing that thing so it
1:18
    doesn't matter if you're saying I'm
1:19
    going to go to the gym tomorrow or I'm
1:21
    going to get in shape you can get down
1:25
    and you can do one pushup
1:27
    right now and doing one pushup
1:29
    accomplishes something that's saying I'm
1:32
    going to to a push-up does not and that
1:35
    is action when you do one push-up you no
1:40
    longer are a person that says you're
1:43
    going to do something and take the
1:45
    action of saying you're going to do
1:46
    something you are simply a person that
1:49
    does that thing if your goal is to get
1:52
    in shape and you haven't made it to the
1:54
    gym do one air squat right now that book
1:58
    on the shelf that you've been wanting to
1:59
    read for a long time read one page of it
2:02
    right now that instrument that's been
2:05
    sitting in the corner of your room
2:06
    collecting dust for the last three
2:08
    months play it for one minute
2:10
    seriously that's all you have to do and
2:14
    then do it again tomorrow if I told you
2:18
    to do one push-up per day for seven days
2:20
    in a row do you think you could do it I
2:22
    would have to imagine yes so in week two
2:26
    on the eighth day do you think you could
2:29
    do two push-ups it's only one more than
2:31
    you did for the entire week before so of
2:34
    course of course you can do two push-ups
2:36
    for an entire week so then in week three
2:40
    it makes a lot of sense that you're
2:41
    probably going to be able to do three
2:43
    push-ups in a row because you spent the
2:45
    entirety of last week doing to think
2:48
    about where you'll be in week 52 let's
2:52
take this from the inverse as well what
if I told you to do a hundred push-ups
every day this week
unless you've been doing that already I
guarantee you that you would fail by
doing a hundred push-ups in a row or in
however many sets you can you break the
chain because you'll be so sore the next
day you won't be able to continue your
habit 9
